# Rails Task Management API: README

## Overview

This Rails Task Management API provides a robust solution for managing tasks, users, and their assignments. Designed with simplicity and scalability in mind, it offers a comprehensive set of features suitable for a wide range of task management needs.

## Setup

To get started with the Rails Task Management API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-link.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd task_management_api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
   ```

5. Start the Rails server:
   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

Now, the API should be up and running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

The API uses RSpec for testing. Tests are located in the `spec` directory, with subdirectories for models, requests, and services. To run the tests, execute:

```bash
rspec
```

This will run the entire test suite and output the results.

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- **Users**:
    - `GET /api/users`: List all users.
    - `POST /api/users`: Create a new user.
    - `GET /api/users/:id`: Show a single user.
    - `PUT /api/users/:id`: Update a user.
    - `DELETE /api/users/:id`: Delete a user.

- **Tasks**:
    - `GET /api/tasks`: List all tasks.
    - `POST /api/tasks`: Create a new task.
    - `GET /api/tasks/:id`: Show a single task.
    - `PUT /api/tasks/:id`: Update a task.
    - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`: Delete a task.
    - `POST /api/tasks/:id/assign`: Assign a task to a user.
    - `PUT /api/tasks/:id/progress`: Update task progress.

- **Statistics and Filters**:
    - `GET /api/tasks/overdue`: List all overdue tasks.
    - `GET /api/tasks/status/:status`: List tasks by status (pending, completed, etc.).
    - `GET /api/tasks/completed`: List tasks completed within a certain date range.
    - `GET /api/tasks/statistics`: Get statistical data of tasks.

Each endpoint supports standard RESTful actions and returns JSON responses.

## Room for Improvement

While the API covers basic task management functionality, there are several areas where it could be enhanced:

- **API Versioning**: Implementing versioning can help manage changes more effectively and maintain compatibility.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Adding user authentication and role-based access control would enhance security.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implementing caching and query optimization could improve response times and reduce server load.
- **Real-time Updates**: Utilizing ActionCable for WebSocket connections could allow real-time updates for task changes.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Expanding the test suite to cover edge cases and failure scenarios would improve reliability.

These enhancements would provide a more robust and user-friendly API, catering to a broader range of task management needs.
